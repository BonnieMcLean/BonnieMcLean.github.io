This paper is the culmination of a longstanding collaborative effort led by Kimi Akita from Nagoya University. We started the phonosemantic maps with data from Japanese and English (see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NhMszLjBaVynXeFuwEa2xtCih-BUd1UP/view)), then teamed up with Jiyeon Park and Arthur Lewis Thompson to add data from Korean and Mandarin Chinese respectivelyðŸ˜„ It was a really fun collaborative project and it's great to see the results finally come to fruition! <!--more-->

The main research question was are iconic associations independent of one another, or linked? Say we find that the same sound is associated with two different meanings, Y and Z. The logical possibilities for explaining how that sound came to be associated with both those meanings are shown in the figure below (Figure 1 from the paper).

Either
 - The two meanings are instances of some broader meaning X that is associated with the sound (A)
 - One of the sound-meaning links is prior, while the other is the result of a metaphorical extension from the first meaning (B)
- The two meanings are instances of some broader meaning X that is associated with the sound, and there is additionally a metaphorical link between them (C)
- Both meanings are directly associated with the sound, but these two associations are independent (D)

To investigate this, we explored Japanese, English, Korean and Mandarin Chinese speakers associations with different sounds, along three semantic scales: size, brightness, and hardness. We found the same sounds associated with meanings spanning multiple of these scales, but the combinations of meanings that we found did not match any known metaphorical or metonymic relations (nor any reported colexifications). That is, the patterns we found were more likely to be explained by situations of the type A and D rather than B or C.
