If you want to know a little more about me, what got me into linguistics and, more importantly, iconicity (!) you can read my interview with [Babel The Language Magazine](https://babelzine.co.uk/) below. This was published in the August 2022 edition of Babel, available [here](https://cloud.3dissue.com/18743/41457/106040/issue40/index.html?page=40). Special thank you to Kimi Akita for helping me with the definitions of the Japanese ideophones for crying, and to John Huisman for helping me with the illustrations!

**Q: How did you first get into linguistics?**  
I’ve always loved learning languages. At the Australian National University where I did my undergraduate degree, all first year language students take Introduction to Linguistics. Most students hate it, but a small percentage adore it – these students go into linguistics. Obviously, I was one of them.

**Q: What do you look at when you look at iconicity?**  
‘Iconicity’ is a term from semiotics, which is the study of meaning. An iconic sign is a sign whose form resembles its meaning. For example, a picture is an iconic sign because it looks like what it represents.   
For a long time, linguists considered a defining feature of words to be their lack of iconicity. The so-called ‘arbitrariness of the linguistic sign’ (made famous by Ferdinand de Saussure) was very important to historical linguistics: if the relationship between the form of a word and its meaning was arbitrary, then we should not expect two unrelated languages to use similar-sounding words for the same meanings. We could then posit that since, for example, the fruit that English speakers call an ‘apple’ is called _appel_ in Dutch, and _äpple_ in Swedish, these three languages are likely to have some shared history.   
An obvious exception to this is onomatopoeia. Neither chance nor relatedness explains the similarity between English _moomoo_ [mu:mu:] and Japanese _moomoo_ [mo:mo:] for the sound a cow makes. These two words sound similar because they are used to mimic the sounds produced by the same animal. Early proponents of linguistic arbitrariness downplayed these examples because, at least in the Western European languages with which they were familiar, such depictive uses of language were considered ‘marginal’. However, this is far from the case in other parts of the world. In many languages, particularly in Asia and Africa, onomatopoeic words are very common, and not only mimic sounds but also movements, shapes, colours, textures, tastes, smells, and even feelings and emotions—the whole gamut of sensory experience. Depictive uses of language are also very common in sign languages, and in gesture, which we all use, and which is intimately connected to spoken language.    
There is now a growing body of research to attest that iconicity is a key feature of language. It helps children when they are learning language, makes words easier for adults to process, and makes face-to-face communication smoother and more fun. Moreover, when we compare words with the same meaning across unrelated languages, we find commonalities in the sounds employed. This suggests that iconicity is more prevalent than previously thought—even in ordinary words. For example, words for ‘nose’ are more likely to contain nasal sounds like m or n.    

**Q: What got you interested in these areas of linguistics?**  
I got interested in iconicity through learning Japanese, which has a large class of iconic words called ideophones or mimetics. Some examples are fuwafuwa ‘fluffy’ and kirakira ‘glittery’. I found these words both fun and useful, because they are highly expressive and can be easily modified to succinctly but precisely depict sensations that, in English for example, we might only be able to describe through a medium like gesture. For instance, when talking about someone crying, you can convey a lot of information about the tears’ volume, shape, size, and motion through the choice of an ideophone like _poroporo_, _boroboro_, _horohoro_ or _harahara_. _Poroporo_ and _boroboro_ are used for round tears ‘bursting out’ in an uncontrolled way, with _boroboro_ denoting fatter and more intensely overflowing tears than _poroporo_. A bout of crying in a small child could begin poroporo with small drops, and build up to _boroboro_ tears. _Horohoro_ and _harahara_, by comparison, involve ‘shedding’ tears in a quieter, more graceful way—tears flowing _harahara_ appear quickly one after the other, whereas _horohoro_ tears are more delineated in drops.
