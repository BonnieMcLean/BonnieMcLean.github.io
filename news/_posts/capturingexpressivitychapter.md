My favourite bits are...

This figure, which John Huisman kindly helped me with:

It shows all the different techniques you can use for documenting ideophones and exploring their meanings, along with suggestions for how they can be combined and how they can feed into each other. See the introduction of the paper for more details.

This epic table in the supplementary materials, which provides a very detailed framework for doing stimulus based elicitation with ideophones (yay!)

And these cool visualisations I made using R Shiny showing the structure of the Siwu ideophone lexicon, and some connections between Japanese ideophones. The Siwu one is based on MDS data from Dingemanse (CITE). The code for making these graphs is available on the osf repo here.

This chapter was so exciting for me, I want to use it as my guidebook for a postdoc hopefully doing documentary research on ideophones, because ideophones are the best and I love them more than anything else!
