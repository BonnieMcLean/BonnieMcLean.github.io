This paper is the culmination of a longstanding collaborative effort led by Kimi Akita from Nagoya University. We started the phonosemantic maps with data from Japanese and English (see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NhMszLjBaVynXeFuwEa2xtCih-BUd1UP/view)), then teamed up with Jiyeon Park and Arthur Lewis Thompson to add data from Korean and Mandarin Chinese respectivelyüòÑ It was a really fun collaborative project and it's great to see the results finally come to fruition! <!--more-->

The main research question was are iconic associations in spoken languages independent of one another, or linked? Say we find that the same sound is associated with two different meanings, Y and Z. The logical possibilities for explaining how that sound came to be associated with both those meanings are shown in the figure below (Figure 1 from the paper).

Either
 - The two meanings are instances of some broader meaning X that is associated with the sound (A)
 - One of the sound-meaning associations is prior, while the other is the result of a metaphorical extension from the first meaning (B)
- (C) in the figure above is a combination of situations (A) and (B). So it could be that there is some higher level semantic feature that connects both meanings to the sound, but also a metaphorical link between the two meanings
- Or, as in (D), the two sound-meaning associations could also be independent. This is possible because iconicity is in general selective. That is, it is only certain *aspects* of sound and certain *aspects* of meaning that get mapped, so multiple associations can exist independently and concurrently. We refer to this in the paper as the "pluripotentiality" of iconicity (see paper for further discussion and references).

To investigate this, we explored Japanese, English, Korean and Mandarin Chinese speakers associations with different sounds, along three semantic scales: size, brightness, and hardness. We found the same sounds associated with meanings spanning multiple of these scales, but the combinations of meanings that we found did not match any known metaphorical or metonymic relations (nor any reported colexifications). That is, the patterns we found were more likely to be explained by situations of the type A and D rather than B or C. This is cool because it means that (at least some of) the semantic networks that we find in iconic lexicons are likely unique to those lexicons, while also highlighting how iconicity is pluripotential. 

We also introduce a novel transformation of Haspelmath's semantic maps‚Äîa tool used in typological research on patterns of grammaticalistion, see e.g., Haspelmath (2008)‚Äîinto *phonosemantic maps* for typological explorations of patterns of sound symbolism. 

In a typical semantic map, the base of the map is the cognitive space, and it is onto this cognitive space that the functions of different grammatical morphemes are mapped. In our phonosemantic maps, on the other hand, the base of the map is instead the phonological (or phonetic) space, and it is onto this phonological space that phonosemantic associations are mapped. Whereas in a typical semantic map the assumption is that semantic extension occurs primarily through conceptual links, in our phonosemantic maps we assume that semantic extension occurs primarily via links mediated by iconicity.

The phonosemantic maps we made for the concepts of SIZE, BRIGHTNESS, and HARDNESS in Japanese, English, Mandarin Chinese, and Korean are shown below:

As shown in the map, some associations were widely shared between the languages (e.g. the association between /i/ and small, and the association between /u/ and dark), while others were language specific (e.g. only Japanese speakers formed specific associations with voiceless consonants). 

The most interesting cases are the patterns of multiple associations, especially when we see these same patterns recur across languages. For example, in all four languages we found an association between /u/ and dark, while in three of the languages there was *additionally* an association between /u/ and soft. Neither of these specific associations have been reported on in the literature before. However, the association between /u/ and darkness could be mediated by a more general crossmodal correspondence between pitch and brightness, in which lower frequency sounds are perceived as darker than high frequency sounds (Marks, 1975; Moos et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2018; Cuskley et al., 2019; Anikin and Johansson, 2019; Johansson et al. 2020a). The /u/-darkness association could be one instance of this more general cross-modal correspondence; a situation as in pattern A in the first figure[^1]. 

The association between /u/ and softness has again not been directly reported before. However, Johansson et al. (2020b) suggest a general link between rounded sounds and softness, which could explain a collection of specific connections that they find between /u/ and the concepts BRAIN, BUTTOCKS, and ROTTEN (all soft things). Our data would support this analysis. As for the motivation behind this association, it's hard to say since iconicity is inherently subjective, but we suggest that the the softness of the lips in rounded vowels could match a soft object, or that the rounded shape of the lips evokes a dull, rather than sharp, image that matches a soft surface (see, e.g., K√∂hler, 1929).

The crucial thing is that softness and darkness would probably never be linked as concepts if it weren't for the mediating factor of iconicity. In fact, in the general lexicon softness is more likely to be associated with brightness rather than darkness, presumably through the positive valence they have in common (for examples, see p.2695 of the paper). An interesting question for future research is thus whether and how semantic networks in the iconic lexicon interact with those of the general lexicon. For example, whether they might interfere with or "block" certain patterns of semantic extension, as has been reported for sign languages (Meir, 2020).

Of course, we only looked at three semantic scales and a handful of phonological contrasts. However, we hope this study will serve as a useful framework for future investigations of iconicity, in particular to unite and compare findings across different studies so that we can better identify, for example, higher-order factors mediating specific iconic associations (Sidhu and Pexman, 2018; Sidhu et al., 2022), and to study how semantic networks in the iconic lexicon differ from those we know from the general lexicon. 

[^1]: The association  between /u/ and DEEP reported in Johansson et al. (2020b) could be another instance of this more general cross-modal association.
