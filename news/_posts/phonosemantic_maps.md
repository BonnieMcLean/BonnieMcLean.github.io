This paper is the culmination of a longstanding collaborative effort led by Kimi Akita from Nagoya University. We started the phonosemantic maps with data from Japanese and English (see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NhMszLjBaVynXeFuwEa2xtCih-BUd1UP/view)), then teamed up with Jiyeon Park and Arthur Lewis Thompson to add data from Korean and Mandarin Chinese respectivelyðŸ˜„ It was a really fun collaborative project and it's great to see the results finally come to fruition! <!--more-->

The main research question was are iconic associations in spoken languages independent of one another, or linked? Say we find that the same sound is associated with two different meanings, Y and Z. The logical possibilities for explaining how that sound came to be associated with both those meanings are shown in the figure below (Figure 1 from the paper).

Either
 - The two meanings are instances of some broader meaning X that is associated with the sound (A)
 - One of the sound-meaning associations is prior, while the other is the result of a metaphorical extension from the first meaning (B)
- (C) in the figure above is a combination of situations (A) and (B). So it could be that there is some higher level semantic feature that connects both meanings to the sound, but also a metaphorical link between the two meanings
- Or, as in (D), the two sound-meaning associations could also be independent. This is possible because iconicity is in general selective. That is, it is only certain *aspects* of sound and certain *aspects* of meaning that get mapped, so multiple associations can exist independently and concurrently. We refer to this in the paper as the "pluripotentiality* of iconicity (see paper for further discussion and references).

To investigate this, we explored Japanese, English, Korean and Mandarin Chinese speakers associations with different sounds, along three semantic scales: size, brightness, and hardness. We found the same sounds associated with meanings spanning multiple of these scales, but the combinations of meanings that we found did not match any known metaphorical or metonymic relations (nor any reported colexifications). That is, the patterns we found were more likely to be explained by situations of the type A and D rather than B or C. This is cool because it means that (at least some of) the semantic networks that we find in iconic lexicons are likely unique to those lexicons, as well as highlighting how iconicity is pluripotential. 

We also introduce a novel transformation of Haspelmath's semantic maps, a tool used in typological research on patterns of grammaticalistion, into *phonosemantic maps* for typological explorations of patterns of sound symbolism. 

In a typical semantic map, the base of the map is the cognitive space, and it is onto this cognitive space that the functions of different grammatical morphemes are mapped. In our phonosemantic maps, on the other hand, the base of the map is instead the phonological (or phonetic) space, and it is onto this phonological space that phonosemantic associations are mapped. Whereas in a typical semantic map the assumption is that semantic extension occurs primarily through conceptual links, in our phonosemantic maps we assume that semantic extension occurs primarily via links mediated by iconicity.

The phonosemantic maps we made for the concepts of SIZE, BRIGHTNESS, and HARDNESS in Japanese, English, Mandarin Chinese, and Korean are shown below:

As shown in the map, some associations were widely shared between the languages (e.g. the association between /i/ and small, and the association between /u/ and dark), while others were language specific (e.g. only Japanese speakers formed specific associations with voiceless consonants). 

The most interesting cases are the patterns of multiple associations, especially when we see these same patterns recur across languages. For example, in all four languages we found an association between /u/ and dark, while in three languages there was *additionally* an association between /u/ and soft.




was found in all four languages), and some were language specific ()


 raising questions about how such networks might interact with semantic relations in the general lexicon. For instance, whether they might interfere with or "block" certain patterns of semantic extension, as has been reported for sign languages (Meir, 2020).
