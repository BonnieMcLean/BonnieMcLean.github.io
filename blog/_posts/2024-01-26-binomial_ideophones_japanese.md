Today I wanted to write about this cool new phenomenon that is becoming increasingly common in Japanese, which involves the compounding of pairs of ideophones, or of single ideophones with prosaic words.

Kimi Akita and Keiko Murasagi have written a very interesting paper on it in the journal *Morphology*, see the citation below:
