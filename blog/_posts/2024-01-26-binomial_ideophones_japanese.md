Today I wanted to write about this cool new phenomenon that is becoming increasingly common in Japanese, which involves the compounding of pairs of ideophones, or of single ideophones with prosaic words.

Kimi Akita and Keiko Murasagi have written a very interesting paper on it in the journal *Morphology*, see the citation below:

> Akita, K., Murasugi, K. Binomial adjective doublets in Japanese: A Relational Morphology account. Morphology 32, 281â€“297 (2022). [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11525-022-09395-z](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11525-022-09395-z)

Below are some fun examples:

|form        |compound |meaning|
|------------|---------|-------|
|*mogyu.fuwa*|IDEO+IDEO|chewy (*mogyumogyu*) and fluffy (*fuwafuwa*)|
|*gaku.buru* |IDEO+IDEO|knocking together (*gakugaku*) and shaking (*buruburu*)|
|*fuwa.toro* |IDEO+IDEO|fluffly (*fuwafufwa*) then melting (*torotoro*), of Japanese omelettes|
|*toro.uma*    |IDEO+ADJ |melting (*torotoro*) and delicious (*uma.i*), of kobe beef|

The picture at the top of this post is of some lollies that are *mogyu.fuwa*.

You could say the following is *gakuburu*:
