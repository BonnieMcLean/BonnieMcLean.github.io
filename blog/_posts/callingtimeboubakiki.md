Unpopular opinion: As an iconicity researcher, I'm over bouba kiki! I think that the obsession with this effect and the virality of it in the media (it's even on Tik Tok now!), while great for promoting linguistics and iconicity research to the general public, has reached the point where it's becoming detrimental to the field of iconicity research. We could be making much more progress, but instead we are stuck doing a thousand different iterations of bouba kiki, when the bouba kiki paradigm is very limited and plagued with methodological issues (more on this below). Bouba kiki has had 100 years of our time now. This year, let's move on from this effect, think bigger, and prioritise research into iconicity in natural languages, which still have so much more to teach us! We've squeezed all we can out of this quirky little sound symbolic effect. There's much more interesting questions to explore now.
