  Writing this because hormones are evil, biology doesn't care about you, and I want an objective record of the pros and cons of this in case I ever want to try it again!

If you're a human with hormones, at some point in your life you may find yourself wanting babies, which may also lead to you wanting to get pregnant. One thing you have to remember here is that your body and biology don't give a shit about you! They are just trying to repopulate! So if you're thinking about getting pregnant, and you care about *you*, read this first so you know what you're getting yourself into (speaking to my future self here)! Also good reading/warning for partners of people who want to get pregnant.

Writing this on pregnancy day 117 at 6am because that's when my body wakes up now (I *used* to wake up at 9am; consider yourselves warned). Still have a whopping 164 days to go but I wanted to start making this list of the pros and cons of pregnancy now (might do another post later on babies themselves) so my traitorous hormones don't brainwash me into forgetting all the bad stuff because I'm starting to forget already and I don't want to! I need to be able to make an informed decision if I ever want to do this again. 

Want to preface this by saying that these are just my experiences, every pregnancy is different of course (seems to be random roulette whether you have a good or bad experience though I feel like the good ones are possibly over represented on social media). I would consider my pregnancy to be an average pregnancy; there are people who have it a lot worse than me, and some annoying unicorn people who have it a lot better ðŸ¦„ But you can take the stuff I've written here as like a minimum baseline of what to expect. 

I knew going in that pregnancy would be difficult, but it's been *more* difficult and difficult in *different ways* than how I expected from what I've read in the media/online, and what people have told me. I don't regret getting pregnant, I still want a baby (traitorous hormones!), and until they make some more progress with artificial wombs (I've been googling) this is my best option for that, but still it would've been nice to have a more objective voice to inform me about it going in. So that's what I'm trying to do here.
