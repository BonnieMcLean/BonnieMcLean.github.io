Starting with the article inspiring this post, you can find (and cite) it below:

 > Ker√§nen, J. (2023). Cross-modal iconicity and indexicality in the production of lexical sensory and emotional signs in Finnish Sign Language. [*Cognitive Linguistics*](https://doi.org/10.1515/cog-2022-0070) 34(3-4): 333-369. doi.org/10.1515/cog-2022-0070

I wanted to write a post on this fantastic new paper by my friend and colleague [Jarkko Ker√§nen](https://www.jyu.fi/en/people/jarkko-keranen)! Jarkko is doing his PhD thesis on cross-modal iconicity in Finnish Sign Language‚Äîwhich is such a cool topic!‚Äîat the University of Jyv√§skyl√§ in Finland, and we are basically in the same year too üòÑ

There is a lot to love in this paper (and I've included my full set of notes on all the most interesting things at the end of this post), but probably my favourite thing is Jarkko's discussion of iconicity, and in particular *proprioceptive iconicity*. 

As Jarkko points out, analyses of iconicity in language are most often from the point of view of the *perception*, rather than *production* of signs. As also discussed in Emmorey et al. (2009), the most important difference between production and perception is that in production we also have *articulatory feedback*, which can result in a sense of *proprioceptive iconicity*. Jarkko illustrates this with the example of the sign HAMMERING from FinSL. He explains that when producing the HAMMERING sign, the signer perceives not only the visual iconicity of the sign from the handshape which resembles the shape of the HAMMER, but there is also a proprioceptive iconicity in how producing the sign _feels_, which extends across the entire body as producing the sign mimics the action of hammering. 

As a comparable example from spoken languages, I thought about the Japanese ideophone *netyanetya* [net Éa.net Éa], which means 'sticky', and which *feels* sticky to say in your mouth, as well as sounding sticky. Try saying it yourself and you'll see. Interestingly, in a study of iconicity ratings and sensory experience ratings for English words, by Bodo Winter and colleagues (Winter et al. 2017), tactile words were found to be most iconic, after words for sounds. And this has also been found in signed languages (iconicity is even stronger in signs for haptic meanings than it is in signs with visual meanings, Perlman et al. 2018).

Iconicity of English words by sensory modality (modality data are from Lynott & Connell, 2009, 2013; Winter, 2016a); points indicate linear model fits with 95% confidence intervals. Taken from Winter et al. 2017 (p.444)

The authors attributed this finding to the close relationship between our senses of sound and touch, but I am wondering now whether proprioceptive iconicity might also have an explanatory role here. 

The diagram at the top of this post is inspired by Figure 1 in Jarkko's paper, and is supposed to illustrate the different mechanisms for iconicity in spoken language (Jarkko's diagram is for FinSL). I've included audition and proprioception as given, since in saying a word you both hear and feel it as you produce it, while vision I've included in dotted lines, to indicate that spoken language iconicity is very often accompanied by visual iconicity as well in the form of gesture. According to Emmorey et al. (2009), the proprioceptive iconicity would only be available to the producer of the sign, but I am wondering now whether that is really true, since we know that we have 'mirror neurons' that are activated both when performing an action ourselves, as well as when witnessing others performing the same action. Proprioceptive iconicity is probably stronger in production, but may not necessarily be absent from perception, especially when perceiving a sign from a language that you speak (not sure how it would work with a foreign language). In any case, it's an interesting open question for future research.

That's the main thing I wanted to talk about from this paper, but I've also included some bullet points below of other interesting concepts and findings from the article, because there really are a lot!
