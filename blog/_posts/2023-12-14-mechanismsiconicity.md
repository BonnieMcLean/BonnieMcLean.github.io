Starting with the article inspiring this post, you can find (and cite) it below:

Wanted to write a post on this fantastic new paper by my friend and colleague Jarkko Ker√§nen! Jarkko is doing his PhD thesis on cross-modal iconicity in Finnish Sign Language‚Äîwhich is such a cool topic!‚Äîat the University of Jyv√§skyl√§ in Finland, and we are basically in the same year too üòÑ

There is a lot to love in this paper (and I've included my full set of notes on all the most interesting things at the end of this post), but probably my favourite thing in the paper is Jarkko's discussion of iconicity and in particular *proprioceptive iconicity*. 

As Jarkko points out, analyses of iconicity in language are most often from the point of view of the *perception*, rather than *production* of signs. As also discussed in Emmorey et al. (2009), the most important difference between production and perception is that in production we also have *articulatory feedback*, which can result in a sense of *proprioceptive iconicity*. Jarkko illustrates this with the example of the sign HAMMERING from FinSL. He explains that when producing the HAMMERING sign, the signer perceives not only the visual iconicity of the sign from the handshape which resembles the shape of the HAMMER, but there is also a proprioceptive iconicity in how producing the sign _feels_, which extends across the entire body as producing the sign mimics the action of hammering. 

As a comparable example from spoken languages, I thought about the Japanese ideophone *netyanetya* [net Éa.net Éa], which means 'sticky', and which *feels* sticky to say in your mouth, as well as sounding sticky. Try saying it yourself and you'll see. Interestingly, in a study of iconicity ratings and sensory experience ratings for English words, by Bodo Winter and colleagues (Winter et al. 2017), tactile words were found to be most iconic, after words for sounds.

Iconicity by sensory modality (modality data are from Lynott & Connell, 2009, 2013; Winter, 2016a); points indicate linear model fits with 95% confidence intervals. Taken from Winter et al. 2017 (p.444)
