  A bit about how we are (hoping to) manage with a new baby in our 50sqm, one bedroom apartment. For those interested in small living!

Very soon there will be three of us in our small, Uppsala apartment. Now that we have everything ready for our new arrival, I'm amazed by how much you can really do with just 50sqm and two rooms (one bedroom, one living)! Although I know we won't be able to stay here forever, for the next few months I'm really looking forward to bunkering down and living small!

In Sweden, the cost of your home insurance is dependent on the size of the place in square meters, and recently I've been getting an almost perverse thrill out of how we are maximising the cost we're paying in rent, home insurance by squeezing as much into those 50 square meters as possible. 

Some of the space-saving things that have saved us are:

**1. We don't have a dining table.**

Instead, we got a massive kitchen island that doubles as a space for eating and food prep, as well as functioning as a desk for working at home. We designed it ourselves so it's really optimised to our specific needs. Of course, first thing on the list (and my favourite feature) was a spot to store all our alcohol for cocktails! Not that I'm getting much use out of it at the momentðŸ˜¢

In Sweden, you can't get wine or beer in the supermarket, only at these state sanctioned stores called *systembolaget* (a sexy name, I know). There's no systembolaget in our local area (which I feel like is surely a crime against everyone who lives here, it's not like we live in the middle of nowhere!) so when we moved we switched from drinking wine and beer to cocktails since hard liquor lasts longer and is easier to store, and the mixers we can get at the supermarket. Not sure if that's what the government intended but that was the result for us anyway. I wasn't going to give in that easily!


write about why you think it works here; it's cause Rosendal has so many green spaces, easy access to forest, parks, etc. it doesn't feel claustrophobic

a couple of people have asked why we're still hanging on to our uppsala apartment now that we have the summer house. As much as I love the space and the freedom in the summer house, it's so convenient having the midwife's, doctor's, groceries, pharmacy etc. all within walking distance

and I am still a city girl at heart, I really enjoy a bit of civilisation as well every once in a while, and try to make the most of the city when we are in Uppsala, also with day trips to Stockholm
