Very soon there will be three of us in our small, Uppsala apartment. Now that we have everything ready for our new arrival, I'm amazed by how much you can really do with just 50sqm and two rooms (one bedroom, one living)! Although I know we won't be able to stay here forever, for the next few months I'm really looking forward to bunkering down and living small!

write about why you think it works here; it's cause Rosendal has so many green spaces, easy access to forest, parks, etc. it doesn't feel claustrophobic

a couple of people have asked why we're still hanging on to our uppsala apartment now that we have the summer house. As much as I love the space and the freedom in the summer house, it's so convenient having the midwife's, doctor's, groceries, pharmacy etc. all within walking distance

and I am still a city girl at heart, I really enjoy a bit of civilisation as well every once in a while, and try to make the most of the city when we are in Uppsala, also with day trips to Stockholm
