  A bit about how we are (hoping to) manage with a new baby in our 50sqm, one bedroom apartment. For those interested in small living!

Very soon there will be three of us in our small, Uppsala apartment. Now that we have everything ready for our new arrival, I'm amazed by how much you can really do with just 50sqm and two rooms (one bedroom, one living)! Although I know we won't be able to stay here forever, for the next few months I'm really looking forward to bunkering down and living small!

In Sweden, the cost of your home insurance is dependent on the size of the place in square meters, and recently I've been getting an almost perverse thrill out of how we are maximising the cost we're paying in rent, home insurance by squeezing as much into those 50 square meters as possible. 

Some of the space-saving things that have saved us are:

**1. We don't have a dining table.**

Instead, we got a massive kitchen island that doubles as a space for eating and food prep, as well as functioning as a desk for working at home. We designed it ourselves so it's really optimised to our specific needs. Of course, first thing on the list (and my favourite feature) was a spot to store all our alcohol for cocktails! Not that I'm getting much use out of it at the momentðŸ˜¢

In Sweden, you can't get wine or beer in the supermarket, only at these state sanctioned stores called *systembolaget* (a sexy name, I know). There's no systembolaget in our local area (which I feel like is surely a crime against everyone who lives here, it's not like we live in the middle of nowhere!) so when we moved we switched from drinking wine and beer to cocktails since hard liquor lasts longer and is easier to store, and the mixers we can get at the supermarket. Not sure if that's what the government intended but that was the result for us anyway. I wasn't going to give in that easily!

My second favourite feature is this great pull-out drawer we got for tea. We are big tea drinkers! Can't stand coffee.

But the biggest difference is just the amount of extra prep space we have for cooking now. Since we're really into cooking having the space to do it in was essential and I *love* cooking in this kitchen. We even have counter space for all our appliances, including my beloved Kitchen Aid mixer, pressure cooker, food processor and, our most recent addition, this grill/air fryer that's been fantastic for balcony dinners.    

The balcony in this apartment is also a great feature, and we have a big window that looks out onto the balcony from the kitchen island so I put a bird feeder out there so I can enjoy watching birds while I work (or, get distracted from working...). Summers in Sweden are so short you really have to make the most of them, so being able to eat outside, even if it's only for two or three months a year, is something I really relish. We were also lucky to get an apartment on the top floor, so our balcony has a great view of the forest surrounding our suburb.  

**2. Having a separate wardrobe room**

This seems to be a common feature of Swedish apartments. It felt a bit unnecessary when we first moved in, but now having the little wardrobe room attached to our bedroom has really saved us because we've been able to fit a big changing table in there with loads of drawers and storage space underneath for all of the masses of baby stuff we've been accumulating. I was also able to find a space there to store our baby car seat / carrier, which is the only baby transport device we've decided to buy so we'll see how we manage with just that and baby slings. 

**3. *Not* having a pram**

I've been really reluctant to get a pram because they're just so bulky and annoying, and I have no idea where we would put one. Uppsala is also such a small, walkable town that I'm hoping we won't really need one, and can just carry the baby in a sling while he's small, before moving him to the bike seat once he gets bigger! Cycling is something I've really missed while being pregnant, and Uppsala is such a bike friendly city, I'm looking forward to getting back on the bike with the baby as soon as possible!  

**4. Having a bigger bathroom, and IKEA!**

**5. Maximising wall storage!**

talk about the wall filing cabinet, the wall shelves from ikea we use for duncan's books and toys and all the parenting books I still have to read, and also hanging duncan's baby seat on the wall. Anything you can put on a wall, do it!

**6. Living near the forest, but also services!**

write about why you think it works here; it's cause Rosendal has so many green spaces, easy access to forest, parks, etc. it doesn't feel claustrophobic

a couple of people have asked why we're still hanging on to our uppsala apartment now that we have the summer house. As much as I love the space and the freedom in the summer house, it's so convenient having the midwife's, doctor's, groceries, pharmacy etc. all within walking distance

and I am still a city girl at heart, I really enjoy a bit of civilisation as well every once in a while, and try to make the most of the city when we are in Uppsala, also with day trips to Stockholm

**7. An insane level of organisation**

talk about the label machine, your super impressive filing system in the cupboard under the tv

**8. Cheating...**

Since now I am really showing off I feel obliged to mention that, having said all of this, we still cheat by having the summer house plus our offices at uni where we can store all the extra books that we accumulate through our work/nerdiness, and that enables my addiction to antique shopping. There's no way I could fit all of the cute plates and things I can't resist at secondhand places in just our Uppsala apartment; the bulk of them end up at the summer house!

Not saying that I don't think it would be *doable* to manage with just 50 square meters, you just couldn't be as addicted to shopping as I am!ðŸ˜†
