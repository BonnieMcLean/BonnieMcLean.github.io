Norway has been on my travel list since we moved to Sweden in 2020, especially since Oslo is only a 5 hour train journey away from Stockholm! So so glad we finally got the chance to do it on our babymoon, as this is likely the last longer trip we'll be taking for a little while!

I can strongly recommend train journeys for the pregnant traveler (or any traveler for that matter, this was so scenic!). My husband estimates the longest I can walk at the moment (in the middle of second trimester, supposedly in the prime of the pregnancy!) is 4km, so a holiday that is mostly sitting on trains all day was ideal. We noticed (probably for the same reason) there were also a lot of older travelers on board with us, so just be aware of that as well, some patience may be needed ðŸ˜…

Below is a summary of the whole trip:
