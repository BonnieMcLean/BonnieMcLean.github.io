  Easily the best train journey I have ever taken in my life.

Norway has been on my travel list since we moved to Sweden in 2020, especially since Oslo is only a 5 hour train journey away from Stockholm! So so glad we finally got the chance to do it on our babymoon, as this is likely the last longer trip we'll be taking for a little while!

I can highly recommend train journeys for the pregnant traveler (or any traveler for that matter, this was so scenic!). My husband estimates the longest I can walk at the moment (in the middle of second trimester, supposedly the prime time of the pregnancy!) is 4km, so a holiday that is mostly sitting on trains all day was ideal. We noticed (probably for the same reason) there were also a lot of older travelers on board with us, so just be aware of that as well, some patience may be needed 😅

Below is a summary of the entire trip:

|Day  |Route    |
|-----|---------|
|Day 1|🚆SJ train Uppsala - Stockholm (40 minutes)|
|Day 1|🚆SJ train Stockholm - Oslo (5 hours)|
|Day 2|🚆Vy train Oslo - Myrdal (4.5 hours)|
|Day 2|🚆Vy train Myrdal - Flåm (1 hour)|
|Day 3|🥾Sightseeing in Flåm and Gudvangen|
|Day 4|🛥️Flåm - Gudvangen by electric fjord cruise|
|Day 4|🚍Gudvangen - Voss by bus (Skyss)|
|Day 4|🚆Vy train Voss - Bergen (1.5 hours)|
|Day 5|🥾Sightseeing in Bergen|
|Day 6|🚆Vy train Bergen - Oslo (7 hours)|
|Day 6|🚆SJ train Oslo - Stockholm (5 hours)|
|Day 6|🚆SJ train Stockholm - Uppsala (40 minutes)|

In hindsight, it would've been good to add one more day to the trip and spend the night in Oslo on Day 6, then go back to Uppsala the day after. But unfortunately Johan had to teach so as they say in Japanese, *shou=ga naka-tta* (it couldn't be helped).

We booked the tour through [Norway in a Nutshell](https://www.norwaynutshell.com/original-tour/). You could also organise it yourself and that would likely be cheaper, but we've been so busy getting ready for the baby and with our new summer house lately that I decided to just splurge on a shortcut. It's a self-guided tour, and the information we got through them was all really good. We just organised our own accommodation because the ones they offered did not run cheap. 

We traveled at the end of March and were very lucky with the weather. The only thing was I was hoping to see spring flowers but no such luck yet. I thought since Oslo and Bergen are further south than Uppsala and towards the warm sea, maybe we'd get lucky. We had the first snowdrops in Uppsala just before we left. The only thing I didn't factor in was the effect of altitude 😅 Most of the train journey is in the mountains and there was still snow and frozen waterfalls for a lot of it! I was actually able to wear the spring dresses I brought though, albeit with leggings, thermal undershirts and a massive coat (temperatures were between 7 and 10 degrees).

We'll just have to make the same trip again another time — May or June would be best I think. I've written a summary of all the best bits and tips below.
