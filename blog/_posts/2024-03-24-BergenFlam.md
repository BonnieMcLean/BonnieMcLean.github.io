  Easily the best train journey I have ever taken in my life.

Norway has been on my travel list since we moved to Sweden in 2020, especially since Oslo is only a 5 hour train journey away from Stockholm! So so glad we finally got the chance to do it on our babymoon, as this is likely the last longer trip we'll be taking for a little while!

I can highly recommend train journeys for the pregnant traveler (or any traveler for that matter, this was so scenic!). Johan estimates the longest I can walk at the moment (in the middle of second trimester, supposedly the prime time of the pregnancy!) is 4km, so a holiday that is mostly sitting on trains all day was ideal. We noticed (probably for the same reason) there were also a lot of older travelers on board with us, so just be aware of that as well, some patience may be needed 😅

But all the trains we took were so comfortable, spacious, clean toilets, you can get up and walk around. The longer journeys had a bistro. Beautiful views. I was even able to sleep on Johan for the last train back to Stockholm! So so much better than plane travel (hate planes!).

Anyway, below is a summary of the entire trip:

|Day  |Route    |
|-----|---------|
|Day 1|🚆SJ train Uppsala - Stockholm (40 minutes)|
|Day 1|🚆SJ train Stockholm - Oslo (5 hours)|
|Day 2|🚆Vy train Oslo - Myrdal (4.5 hours)|
|Day 2|🚆Vy train Myrdal - Flåm (1 hour)|
|Day 3|🥾 Sightseeing in Flåm and Gudvangen|
|Day 4|🛥️ Flåm - Gudvangen by electric fjord cruise|
|Day 4|🚍 Gudvangen - Voss by bus (Skyss)|
|Day 4|🚆Vy train Voss - Bergen (1.5 hours)|
|Day 5|🥾 Sightseeing in Bergen|
|Day 6|🚆Vy train Bergen - Oslo (7 hours)|
|Day 6|🚆SJ train Oslo - Stockholm (5 hours)|
|Day 6|🚆SJ train Stockholm - Uppsala (40 minutes)|

In hindsight, it would've been good to add one more day to the trip and spend the night in Oslo on Day 6, then go back to Uppsala the day after. But unfortunately Johan had to teach so as they say in Japanese, *shou=ga naka-tta* (it couldn't be helped).

We booked the tour through [Norway in a Nutshell](https://www.norwaynutshell.com/original-tour/). You could also organise it yourself and that would likely be cheaper, but we've been so busy getting ready for the baby and with our new summer house lately that I decided to just splurge on a shortcut. It's a self-guided tour, and the information we got through them was all really good. We just organised our own accommodation because the ones they offered did not run cheap. 

We traveled at the end of March and were very lucky with the weather. The only thing was I was hoping to see spring flowers but no such luck yet. I thought since Oslo and Bergen are further south than Uppsala and towards the warm sea, maybe we'd get lucky. We had the first snowdrops in Uppsala just before we left. The only thing I didn't factor in was the effect of altitude 😅 Most of the train journey is in the mountains and there was still snow and frozen waterfalls for a lot of it! I was actually able to wear the spring dresses I brought though, albeit with leggings, thermal undershirts and a massive coat (temperatures were between 7 and 10 degrees).

We'll just have to make the same trip again another time — May or June would be best I think. I've written a summary of all the best bits and tips below.

## Oslo

We had very little time in Oslo, so I'd like to come back again, but one thing I can recommend is the restaurant Helt Vilt! They specialise in wild meat, and I had a delicious Arctic Moose burger with brunost and cloudberry dressing, as well as the best rhubarb and apple soda I've had in my life! Brunost means "brown cheese". It's not actually cheese but a by-product of it — caramelised whey, very nice. Norwegians have it on waffles for breakfast (we had that in Bergen later).

## Flåm railway, Myrdal - Flåm

## Flåm

Flåm is a very pretty Fjord village. Things to check out are:

- The train museum! 
- (If you're up for it) hiking—the tourist information centre can give you a map with a lot of routes
- Ægir BryggeriPub (really good food and beer; also pretty much the only restaurant in town so if you're staying multiple nights maybe plan to cook at home for some of them, there's a supermarket in town where you can get everything you need)
- Flåm Bakeri (very good pastries and sandwiches)

## Gudvangen

You can get here from Flåm by bus or scenic fjord cruise. The main thing to do is the Viking village, it was really fun and educational! They want to show people that Vikings were more than just vicious pillaging rapists (although they were that too). But when they were home in Norway apparently they were actually quite chill, civilised people. They had a proto-democracy. Slaves could work in their spare time to eventually buy back their freedom. And if you were a woman and your husband died (not hard to arrange with all the fighting and conquering the vikings did) you inherited all his political rights, so widows could actually become quite powerful.
