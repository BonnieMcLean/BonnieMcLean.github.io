Since taking this trip, I've read in the news that the Jacobite train service has since been suspended (as of March 2024). So I'm feeling very grateful now that we took the trip already in 2022! Read below for tips and a summary of our trip, fingers crossed the train will be restored again someday soon! ðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž

Our journey began with a lot of rain, which made me feel very unlucky until I read that Fort William (where the train leaves from) is in the rainiest part of Scotland, and that 50% of the whole month of July is rain! According to [this webesite](https://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townclimate2108.html) May would actually be the best month to go, although even then the chance of rain is pretty high. 

Still, the rain and mist did make for some atmospheric photos.
